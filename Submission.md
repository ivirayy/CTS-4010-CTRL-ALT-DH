## Abstract
*I-am-Data* is a digitized self-portrait collage displayed on an HTML-based page. This piece explores identity and expression through various levels of data collection, from self-tracking to passive surveillance. Reflecting on the relationship between the online self and the platforms, interfaces, and applications that help shape it, *I-Am-Data* critiques methods used to categorize and monitor users. By visualizing these dynamics, this self-portrait questions the sense of self when defined by data.
