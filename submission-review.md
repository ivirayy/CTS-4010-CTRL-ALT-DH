**Bio:** Jack Hunter-Buffington also known as hbtheblogger. A 4th Year CTS Major in the Co-Op program. Sometimes cycling. Always creating. Staying curious, seeking adventure, and taking photos along the way. He's probably at your local thrift store... or drinking coffee... or both.


**Abstract:** Through this digital game choose your adventure in the creative cycle of making your own bike brand. From sustainable choices to capital entice. What motivates you? How would you shape the future of the cycling industry?

## Introduction

[Play *Bike.inc* on itch.io](https://hbtheblogger.itch.io/bikeinc)

Introducing, Bike.inc. This choose your own adventure story puts you in the shoes as a person looking to build a bike brand, and some of the things you will want to consider as you make your decisions. Take one path, or take them all! This educational game looks to think outside the box. It prompts you to think beyond the game and in your own life. You may be small but thinking consciously should not be avoided.

Using Twine was super fun, and a great tool to create an interactive storytelling game. Personally I love games, and who doesn’t like a choose your own adventure story?

I already have some background knowledge in the area of bicycles from working at a small bike shop for the past 3 and a half years. Though I have put that knowledge into the game, as well as researched a variety of sources throughout the semester on the subject of the bicycle and different aspects that pertain to its role, as a useful tool in society.

Making this narrative made by back hurt. I was invested in it and it really seems endless when you can keep building pathways to more aspects of the game. Would I go further? I said this last time in The Social Media Effect; though I am not sure. Maybe I will add to it someday.

I learned a lot in this short time. Though I wish I could have put all of it and more into the narrative, there is already a lot to unpack in the game. The main thing I would like to leave you to think about when it comes to the bicycle is…

Bicycles are nothing without the rider. You shape the bicycle with whatever your intention is. The bicycle is a creative platform that helps build a personal story.

This narrative assignment was perfectly fitting for that conclusion.

Why?

Well when you see a random bicycle, you will just see it as… a random bicycle. But they are so much more to the people that ride them. Bicycles are a tool for a better life. For a more sustainable world. They bring us together and connect what we know. Every bicycle has unlimited potential.

I would say that this narrative assignment was the perfect final project. After looking at Timelines, Maps, and Networks, this narrative assignment pulls it all together. It has the opportunity to look at progression over time, where things are and how things connect. Though to do all three would take a long time. The narrative aspect offers more personal views. It was probably my favourite format and I would like to use it again.

I will say using Twine is by no means quick to use. It takes a lot of time. But its fun in the end when you look at what you’ve created.

Take good care, and go for a bike ride.

<!-- ## Submission Review by Isabelle Viray

### Communication, Style, and Polish: 3.5/5

The dialogue of *Bike.inc* is clear and concise, with a substantial balance of visual and written context that maintains engagement without overwhelming the user. Your tone throughout is personal and welcoming, and the casual, conversational writing style makes it enjoyable to click through. The game’s structure is logical, from choosing bike materials to marketing, with multiple options that reinforce interactivity. The inclusion of a reflection process adds depth to the creative project, framed with a cohesive introduction and conclusion that wraps up the game. This project’s dedication to the topic elevates its purpose, making the game’s progression feel natural and relevant.

However, there are minor grammatical and punctuation errors that could be easily avoided by proofreading. Various sentences are wordy and could be tightened or split up for digestibility and clarity. Some results lack further context or justifications for the user’s choices, which limits the discussion of research findings that could have grounded your gameplay/explanations in academic relevance. Additionally, some sources lack citations and credibility, and a few hyperlinks appear as dead links or are inaccessible.

### Relevance to Special Issue Theme: 4.5/5

*Bike.Inc* aligns perfectly with this year's theme of creativity in digital spaces! You use Twine, a digital storytelling platform, to create an interactive narrative that discusses sustainability, community, and design. The game ties innovation to digital humanities principles, utilizing a creative and digital tool to explore human culture while creating a space that fosters knowledge and learning. The game’s non-linear format and branches of choices mirror the “creative cycle” of bike-building, emphasizing the freedom of Twine as an open-source creative tool.

To strengthen its connection, you could expand on the creative process of Bike.Inc alongside digital humanities. For example, how does Twine uphold the value of creativity in digital spaces? What advantages does it offer for creative DH projects, and how does it differ from traditional interactive story-making? Reflecting on this could deepen the game’s methodology and theoretical framework.

### Originality, Creativity, Strength of Ideas: 5/5

The concept of an interactive bike-making game is original and intriguing, especially for players new to the subject, as it motivates them to continue learning about environmental awareness. I can easily recognize your passion for bikes, which enriches the game’s experience and makes it genuine and meaningful to play. Teaching sustainability through a choose-your-own-adventure format is an excellent example of using technology for good: providing a playful way to address real-world concerns. Your personal connection and experience add authenticity and intent to the project, grounding it in the co-creativity nature of digital spaces.

There is room to explore varying outcomes of choices. For example, leading to different sustainability paths rather than the same ending each time, or including potential negative outcomes accompanied by a call to action, would enhance depth and replayability.

### Accuracy and Completion of Markdown Code: 4/5

Your markdown file includes the relevant metadata needed for the journal submission, structured properly in adherence to CTRL+ALT+DH’s guidelines. Headings and paragraphs are properly formatted, with appropriate spacing that enhances code readability and compatibility. Your game link is functional, and you make a considerable and clean effort in using markdown syntax and structure. 

Adding additional headings (“	Abstract”, “Takeaways”, “Conclusion”) to separate paragraphs would make for a more organized and sectional read. You could also be creative with syntax styles, such as adding italics, underlined words, or bolded parts to add emphasis to your context and build on the code’s uniqueness. One small note is to omit the time and format the date as “2025-10-08” for consistency.

Well done, Jack! Bike.inc is a well-executed concept, both insightful and fun to navigate. I appreciate your thoughtfulness when creating the project, and each branching path demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. --->
