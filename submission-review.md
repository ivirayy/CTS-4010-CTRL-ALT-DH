## Introduction

[Play *Bike.inc* on itch.io](https://hbtheblogger.itch.io/bikeinc)

Introducing, Bike.inc. This choose your own adventure story puts you in the shoes as a person looking to build a bike brand, and some of the things you will want to consider as you make your decisions. Take one path, or take them all! This educational game looks to think outside the box. It prompts you to think beyond the game and in your own life. You may be small but thinking consciously should not be avoided.

Using Twine was super fun, and a great tool to create an interactive storytelling game. Personally I love games, and who doesn’t like a choose your own adventure story?

I already have some background knowledge in the area of bicycles from working at a small bike shop for the past 3 and a half years. Though I have put that knowledge into the game, as well as researched a variety of sources throughout the semester on the subject of the bicycle and different aspects that pertain to its role, as a useful tool in society.

Making this narrative made by back hurt. I was invested in it and it really seems endless when you can keep building pathways to more aspects of the game. Would I go further? I said this last time in The Social Media Effect; though I am not sure. Maybe I will add to it someday.

I learned a lot in this short time. Though I wish I could have put all of it and more into the narrative, there is already a lot to unpack in the game. The main thing I would like to leave you to think about when it comes to the bicycle is…

Bicycles are nothing without the rider. You shape the bicycle with whatever your intention is. The bicycle is a creative platform that helps build a personal story.

This narrative assignment was perfectly fitting for that conclusion.

Why?

Well when you see a random bicycle, you will just see it as… a random bicycle. But they are so much more to the people that ride them. Bicycles are a tool for a better life. For a more sustainable world. They bring us together and connect what we know. Every bicycle has unlimited potential.

I would say that this narrative assignment was the perfect final project. After looking at Timelines, Maps, and Networks, this narrative assignment pulls it all together. It has the opportunity to look at progression over time, where things are and how things connect. Though to do all three would take a long time. The narrative aspect offers more personal views. It was probably my favourite format and I would like to use it again.

I will say using Twine is by no means quick to use. It takes a lot of time. But its fun in the end when you look at what you’ve created.

Take good care, and go for a bike ride.
